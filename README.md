**Released in 1997. Written in Visual Basic 4.0 and Borland Delphi 3, on Windows 95.**

RGB EasyMix is a small and easy-to-use, yet powerful RGB color editor. With RGB EasyMix you can easily make-up a RGB color by editing the amount of red, green and blue. You can copy the resulting RGB color to the clipboard in many different formats. The yellow color can be copied as:

- a RGB macro: `RGB(255, 255, 0)`
- a C/C++ hexadecimal number: `0x0000FFFF`
- a Pascal/Delphi hexadecimal number: `$0000FFFF`
- a Basic/Visual Basic hexadecimal number: `&H0000FFFF&`
- an Assembly Language hexadecimal number: `0000FFFFH`
- a HTML macro: `#00FFFF`
- a color sample (a bitmap from 8x8 pixels to 256x256 pixels).

You can also define custom colors that can be saved for future use.
